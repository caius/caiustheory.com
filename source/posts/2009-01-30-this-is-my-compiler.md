As some friday fun in [#geekup][girc] we ended up converting the [US Marines Creed][creed] to a geekier version.

> This is my compiler.  
> There are many like it, but this one is MINE.  
> My compiler is my best friend. It is my life.  
> I must master it as I must master my life.  
> My compiler without me is useless. Without my compiler, I am useless.  
> I must run my compiler true.  
> I must run faster than my bug who is trying to kill me.  
> I must squash him before he squashes me. I will...  
> My compiler and myself know that what counts in war is not the warnings we squash,  
> the builds we create, nor the optimisations we make.  
> We know it is the build errors fixed that count. We will fix...  
> My compiler is human, even as I, because it is my life.  
> Thus, I will learn it as a brother.  
> I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its output, its code,  
> its quirks, and its errors.  
> I will ever guard it against the ravages of virii and disk failures.  
> I will keep my compiler clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.  
> We will become part of each other. We will...  
> Before Assembler I swear this creed.  
> My compiler and myself are the defenders of good code.  
> We are the masters of our bugs.  
> We are the saviors of our code.  
> So be it, until code is compiling and there are no bugs, but compiled code.

And then [jamx][] jumped in with the [Lords Prayer][lp]

> Our Compiler, who art in memory. GNU be thy name.  
> Thy source code come, thy will be done.  
> On script as it is in memory.  
> Give us this day our daily data, and forgive us our segfaults as we forgive those who segfault against us.  
> And lead us not into /dev/null but deliver us from M$,  
> for thine is the domain, the cpu and the peeps.  
> for (x=0; x<2; x++){ x=0; }  
> Amen
