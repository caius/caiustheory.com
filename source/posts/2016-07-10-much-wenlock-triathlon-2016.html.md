**500m Pool Swim: 00:11:34**

Felt good setting off, within a couple of lengths felt like I had no energy. Didn’t have enough to eat/drink during the morning before starting, really makes a huge difference once you set off. Must remember to replace my goggles at some point too, the strap comes loose without warning.

**Transition 1: 00:03:06**

Rough time for transition. Legs felt good as soon as I was out the pool. Got my kit on without too much trouble, although taking a t-shirt style cycling top instead of a full zip jacket was a mistake—forgot I’d be putting it on wet. Had a gel in transition in the hope it would give me some energy.

**19km Cycle: 00:48:03**

Lovely start to the cycle route, massive downhill on recently resurfaced roads for the most part. Best part of the cycle ride, with the rest of the route consisting of climbing back up to the start. Couple of nasty steep hills I had to walk sections of, for all I fitted lower gears they still weren't low enough given my lack of bike fitness currently.

**Transition 2: 00:06:57**

Bike racked easily, shoes swapped, gel necked and a couple of Lucozade bottles clutched and off to run. Took on another gel.

**Run: 01:04:37**

Needed all the fluid I carried, didn't take anything else during the run and felt no less energetic than the other disciplines. Legs didn't really hurt, just felt like lead and had no power. Route was basically a mini trail run then up a tarmac road to the turning point then head back via trail run to finish. Adopted a walk/run approach.

**Total: 02:14:17**

Certainly the hardest triathlon I've done, and I'm probably at my least fittest compared to any of the others I've done to boot. The location was lovely, the weather was pretty decent (sunny but not too hot). Don't feel like I was beaten by it, but definitely haven't given it my best. One to redo next year and train towards.
