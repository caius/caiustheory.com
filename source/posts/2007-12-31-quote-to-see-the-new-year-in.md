So I'm a geek, as my friends are gradually realising more and more.  Anyway, I twitter a lot, and occasionally write quotes that need to be saved elsewhere.  And what generally makes tweets funnier are other people replying to them.

A little background information.  This had just taken place in #habari (a chat room.)

    <h0bbel> ringmaster: i'll show you my winky
    * ringmaster runs.
    <h0bbel> as jmullan has seen it
    <h0bbel> i think
    <jmullan> no, I didn't look
    <ringmaster> 0_o
    <h0bbel> i was kinda drunk at the time
    <h0bbel> lol
    <jmullan> we were playing "lightsabers" while peeing
    <jmullan> not "swords"
    <jmullan> I had the yellow saber, h0bbel had the green one
    <jmullan> I'm not sure how that worked
    <h0bbel> you said you didn't look!
    <h0bbel> How did you know it was green?
    <jmullan> I just saw the beam, not the handle, if you know what I'm saying
    <h0bbel> ehehe
    <Caius> xD
    <ringmaster> This is all somewhat disturbing.

So in order
