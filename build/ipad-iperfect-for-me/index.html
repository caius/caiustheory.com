<p>I've been searching for a device to fit between my Macbook Pro and iPhone. I work all day on the MBP, and moving it to then watch video in another room or read twitter/news/mail whilst watching telly, etc is a pain.</p>

<p>The iPhone is a great little device on the move, but for trying to multitask at home it's a bit.. tedious. Even jailbroken and running multiple apps at once it's still limiting.</p>

<p>I'd been looking around at netbooks, but what put me off actually getting one was my previous experience with one. I know I'd want it to run OS X to keep in sync (easily) with my other Apple devices, but hackintoshing one was a bit too much hassle, plus the fact ones to hackintosh cost more than I really wanted to pay for something that wasn't <em>quite</em> what I thought I needed.</p>

<p>And then.. the iPad. I've been sort of keeping up with the rumours (mainly through <a href="http://daringfireball.net">Daring Fireball</a>) and whilst I didn't get excited about it too much ahead of announcement<sup>1</sup>, having seen the official video of it it's pretty much guaranteed that I'm going to get one.</p>

<p>Yes, it's limited (App Store, closed device), but.. I don't care. Take the iPhone, it's good enough for doing things on it, even if someone else is in charge of the ecosystem and has a big finger saying yes or no. I (willingly) use iTunes, Mobile Me, all the things that are so wonderfully integrated in the world of Apple, so another device that consumes my media using channels I already know and use is just a massive win for me.</p>

<p>All I'm hoping now is that $499 doesn't equal £499. Hopefully it'll be £399, still a good £80 above direct exchange rate, but low enough that it's a no-brainer for me to get one.</p>

<p>…And I think this is the first Apple product that I've seen announced and actually known from the start <em>why</em> I'm going to get one, instead of just a knee-jerk "SHINY!!!! WANT!!!" reaction. Uh oh, does that make me an adult?</p>

<p><sup>1</sup> I miss getting really excited about apple announcements :(</p>

<p>It just got even better. Was lamenting to a <a href="http://tmertz.com/">friend</a> on IM that it'd be so much nicer once you can directly suck photos off a camera/SD card into it. Turns out there's an adapter for that. See "iPad Camera Connection Kit" at the bottom of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/">http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs/</a> for details.</p>
