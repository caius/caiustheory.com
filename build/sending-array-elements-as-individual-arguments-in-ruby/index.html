    <main>
      <p>Lets imagine we've got an array of strings, and we want to print it out as a list of strings using printf. <em>(If you're complaining about my logic here, hold fire for just a second good sir/madam.)</em></p>

<p>So we start off with the array of strings, and then pass it to printf with the right amount of <code>%s</code>'s in the format string:</p>

<pre><code>arr = ["one", "two", "three"]

printf "%s, %s, %s", arr
# ~&gt; -:3:in `printf': too few arguments (ArgumentError)
# ~&gt;     from -:3
</code></pre>

<p>Oh whoops, we've actually only passed <code>"%s, %s, %s", ["one", "two", "three"]</code> to printf. So of course it whinges about not getting enough arguments. Now how do we fix this, how <strong>do</strong> we pass an array with each element a seperate argument to a method?</p>

<p>We use the <code>*</code> of course! Just prefix the variable name with <code>*</code> and the method is passed each element as separate arguments, rather than the whole array as one arguement.</p>

<p>Going back to our <code>printf</code> example above, we simply insert one character <em>(the lowly <code>*</code>)</em> and end up with a string being outputted.</p>

<pre><code>printf "%s, %s, %s", *arr
# &gt;&gt; one, two, three
</code></pre>

<p>Now I realise this is a partially stupid example, but it serves to explain the point I wanted to make. If you were complaining about my choice of printf earlier, here is the way I think most rubyists would solve this problem instead.</p>

<pre><code>arr = ["one", "two", "three"]

print arr.join(" ")
# &gt;&gt; one two three
</code></pre>

<p>And if I wanted to be slightly cleverer with the <code>printf</code> version, and print out an array containing an unknown number of strings, but of a set width, then I could do the following. <em>(NB: This is actually how I ran into this problem.)</em></p>

<pre><code>arr = ["one", "two", "three"]

printf arr.map { "%6s" }.join, *arr
# &gt;&gt;    one   two three
</code></pre>

<p>And that is where the lowly <code>*</code> comes in.</p>
