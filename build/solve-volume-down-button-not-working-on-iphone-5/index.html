      <p>I noticed this morning that my volume down button (-) wasn't working on my iPhone 5 running iOS 7. Pushing the physical button in didn't change the volume. The volume up button increased the volume successfully still.</p>

<p>As is my normal first step debugging iPhone weirdness, I rebooted the phone by turning it off, leaving it off for a few seconds, then booting it back up with the power button. Once powered off and on in this way, the volume down key still didn't decrease the volume.</p>

<p>Fearing a physical button issue at this point, I turned to google for suggestions on what else to try. Running across <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/4894152">this thread</a> on Apple's discussion forums, I tried out the solution in there.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Open "Settings"</li>
  <li>Scroll down and tap on "General"</li>
  <li>Tap on "Accessibility"</li>
  <li>Scroll down to the bottom and tap on "AssistiveTouch"</li>
  <li>Tap the toggle for AssistiveTouch to turn it on, and you should see a little icon appear on screen (white circle contained in a dark grey rounded square)</li>
  <li>Tap the AssistiveTouch icon (was in the top left corner on screen for me)</li>
  <li>Tap on "Device"</li>
  <li>Tap "Volume Down" a bunch of times and you should see the volume being turned down</li>
  <li>Tap outside the AssistiveTouch dialog to close it</li>
  <li>Try pushing the physical Volume Down button</li>
</ol>

<p>In my case, following these steps made my physical volume down button start working again. Makes me wonder if the solution author on the apple discussion thread is right, in that this is a software issue and forcing a volume down action through the on-screen interface makes it remember that there's a physical button to respond to as well.</p>

<p>Either way, I can stop deafening myself whenever I receive a notification now!</p>
