      <p><em>This is another old post that I'm republishing. Originally published 27th April 2007.</em></p>

<p>My text editor <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> has a nice feature called "Filter through command" whereby you can filter the current document through a command.</p>

<p>Anyway, I've never used it before, but today I had a text file with 30 or so url's in, each on a new line, so I thought I'd test it out.  I selected it to input the document &amp; to not replace the output.  I then entered the following command, which is a ruby command to take each line that isn't blank, and run the shell command <code>open $url</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'a = ARGF.read.scan(/\S+/); a.each { |x| `open #{x}` }'
</code></pre>

<p>What this does is take ARGF (the document) and read it in line by line, but only the non-whitespace characters (so newlines, space, etc are ignored.)  And it assigns it to an array called <code>a</code>.  What I then do is for each item of <code>a</code>, we run it past the shell command <code>open</code>, which on OS X if you pass it a URL it just opens that URL in the default browser.</p>

<p>My browser is Safari, and its set to open new links in a new tab in the foremost window.  So I ran the command, and hey presto, within a few seconds I had all the URL's loading in seperate tabs in Safari's foremost window!</p>

<p>The power of Unix <em>(OS X)</em> &amp; TextMate (amongst other tools) just never ceases to amaze me.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>

<p>I just realised if you change the regex to scan for http://.* then it'll select all website URLs.</p>

<pre><code>ruby -e 'a = ARGF.read.scan(/^http://.*$/); a.each { |url| `open #{url}` }'
</code></pre>
