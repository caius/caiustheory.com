    <main>
      <p>So mother (who can't program) just posed me the question</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Why is Ruby your favourite programming language?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Me being a show off jumped straight into <a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> and banged out some code in real time to show her.  First up, a quick little one-liner of Ruby code to output a String:</p>

<pre><code>puts "Hello World"
# =&gt; "Hello World"
</code></pre>

<p>So she goes, "Sure, but whats so brilliant about that?" So I just decide to reverse the string, have it output in reverse order:</p>

<pre><code>puts "Hello World".reverse
# =&gt; "dlroW olleH"
</code></pre>

<p>Then the next question comes, "So what makes that so much easier than in other languages?" Well now I was thinking on the spot about which other language I can bang out a quick example in without having to look up too much information.  PHP seems the logical choice, being the language I know best behind Ruby.</p>

<p>Thinking about how to do it in PHP, I can't think of a function to reverse the content of a string, but I know that <code>array_reverse()</code> exists, so I just split it into an array and reverse that array.  Only problem is I can't remember how to split a string by <code>""</code>, I don't think <code>explode( "", $var )</code> does the job.  So I quickly jump in and write the following code to test my concern.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$a = "Hello World"
$b = explode( "", $a );
$c = array_reverse( $b );
echo implode( "", $c );
?&gt;
# =&gt; ERROR
</code></pre>

<p>The reason for the error is because I've missed a semi colon off the end of line 2, to this I get the response, "well thats certainly not as nice as ruby." Just because one little character is missing!</p>

<p>So I fix the semi colon and run it again, now I get an error complaining about explode not being able to split by a missing delimiter (the empty string - <code>""</code>)  So I go hunting through the <a href="http://php.net/">php.net</a> docs and find <code>str_split()</code>, which does exactly what I want it to.</p>

<p>In replacing <code>explode()</code> with <code>str_split()</code> and running it via the <code>php</code> command line binary, I realise that I haven't got any <code>\n</code> (newlines) at the end of it, so it doesn't display nicely in the terminal.  I thus update the script to the following and show her the result:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php
$a = "Hello World";
$b = explode( "", $a );
$c = array_reverse( $b );
echo implode( "", $c )."\n";
?&gt;
# =&gt; "dlroW olleH"
</code></pre>

<p>And so she goes away seeing why I prefer Ruby to other languages for <em>most</em> programming I do. There are things Ruby fails at (and don't get me started on why rails isn't going to replace php!) and other places where it succeeds very well.</p>

<p>But each to their own, and my own favourite is Ruby!</p>

<h3 id="update">Update</h3>

<p>As pointed out in the comments, if I had looked a bit further I would've found <code>strrev()</code> which does the same as the <code>reverse</code> method in Ruby.  So in fact the final code would be:</p>

<pre><code># Ruby Code
puts "Hello World".reverse

# PHP Code
echo strrev( "Hello World" );
</code></pre>

<p>So it turns out this was a bad way to show why I prefer Ruby to PHP code wise to mother, think I might have to just bite the bullet and write about why I prefer <code>object.method</code> to <code>method( object )</code>!</p>
