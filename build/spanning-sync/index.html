      <p>So for <a title="Brightbox - Serious rails hosting" href="http://www.brightbox.co.uk">work</a> I have to subscribe to a shared google calendar the company uses. Annoyingly this can't be through my Google Apps account though, it has to be through my normal google account.</p>

<p>Also annoying is the fact google doesn't let me subscribe to my shared calendars without making them 100% public. Which means the shared private calendar work uses would have to be a <em>public</em> shared calendar, which is obviously not going to happen. (Can't have everyone knowing when the secret drinking parties are!)</p>

<p>Thankfully, there is already a solution out there to this problem, and it comes in the form of a Preference Pane called <a title="Spanning Sync" href="http://spanningsync.com/">SpanningSync</a> that syncs iCal to Google Calendar. All you need to do is install the prefpane and enter your google email/password (which is then safely secured in your keychain I believe.)</p>

<p>What it does is stick an icon in the menubar, and then at a pre-defined (and customisable) interval, sync any new changes between the local iCal calendar and the remote shared calendar in your google acccount.</p>

<p>Spanning Sync is only $25 to register for the year, but you can save yourself $5 by entering <strong>6EMQAC</strong> as the spanning sync coupon code, or <a href="http://spanningsync.com/?r=6EMQAC">clicking here</a></p>
