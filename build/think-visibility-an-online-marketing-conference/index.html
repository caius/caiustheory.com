      <p>Now I'm not one for blogging about events usually—if I'm attending one then I'll just talk about it on <a href="http://twitter.com/caius">twitter</a> quite a bit beforehand. However, seeing as this one is being organised by my housemate and I like to keep him in a good mood so he doesn't do something daft like change the locks, I figured I'd blog about this one. <em>(Also its really rather a good idea, I'll be paying to attend and think he's bloody mad to organise a conference!)</em></p>

<p>The conference is <a href="http://www.thinkvisibility.com/">Think Visibility</a>, which is a</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>one-day mini conference with a focus on the areas of web development and marketing which are usually left behind in the creation process: SEO, PPC, Monetisation, Blogging, Accessibility and Usability.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <a href="http://www.thinkvisibility.com/speakers.html">speaker line-up</a> has rather a lot of big names in it if you follow the SEO/Online marketing world, and its only £30 to turn up for the day and listen to them speak. Oh, and theres an afterparty with free drinks <em>(Sponsor permitting)</em> where you can get drunk with your hero's. (Or something.)</p>

<p>Me, I'm attending simply because up until a year or so ago I thought SEO was a complete heap of crap, but having known <a href="http://www.thehodge.co.uk/">Dom</a> for a while, and worked for an SEO agency, I'm starting to appreciate that there is an art to it, and it is a much needed skill to run a successful website.</p>
