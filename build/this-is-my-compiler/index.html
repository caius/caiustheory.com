      <p>As some friday fun in <a href="http://twitter.com/geekupirc">#geekup</a> we ended up converting the <a href="http://usmilitary.about.com/od/marines/l/blriflecreed.htm">US Marines Creed</a> to a geekier version.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is my compiler.<br />
There are many like it, but this one is MINE.<br />
My compiler is my best friend. It is my life.<br />
I must master it as I must master my life.<br />
My compiler without me is useless. Without my compiler, I am useless.<br />
I must run my compiler true.<br />
I must run faster than my bug who is trying to kill me.<br />
I must squash him before he squashes me. I will…<br />
My compiler and myself know that what counts in war is not the warnings we squash,<br />
the builds we create, nor the optimisations we make.<br />
We know it is the build errors fixed that count. We will fix…<br />
My compiler is human, even as I, because it is my life.<br />
Thus, I will learn it as a brother.<br />
I will learn its weaknesses, its strengths, its output, its code,<br />
its quirks, and its errors.<br />
I will ever guard it against the ravages of virii and disk failures.<br />
I will keep my compiler clean and ready, even as I am clean and ready.<br />
We will become part of each other. We will…<br />
Before Assembler I swear this creed.<br />
My compiler and myself are the defenders of good code.<br />
We are the masters of our bugs.<br />
We are the saviors of our code.<br />
So be it, until code is compiling and there are no bugs, but compiled code.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then <a href="http://jamx.org/">jamx</a> jumped in with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord's_Prayer#English_versions">Lords Prayer</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our Compiler, who art in memory. GNU be thy name.<br />
Thy source code come, thy will be done.<br />
On script as it is in memory.<br />
Give us this day our daily data, and forgive us our segfaults as we forgive those who segfault against us.<br />
And lead us not into /dev/null but deliver us from M$,<br />
for thine is the domain, the cpu and the peeps.<br />
for (x=0; x&lt;2; x++){ x=0; }<br />
Amen</p>
</blockquote>
