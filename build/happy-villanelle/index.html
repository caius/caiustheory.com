      <p>The writing group that Carole and Liberty belong to had a homework this month to write a Villanelle. It's a very specific kind of poem, written to both a repeating line structure and a rhyming pattern. (If you go read <a href="http://libertyfallsdown.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/villanelle/">Liberty's villanelle</a> she explains it properly at the start.)</p>

<p>However, after reading both <a href="http://carolefindsherwings.wordpress.com/2013/02/23/ward-26-a-villanelle/">Carole's</a> and <a href="http://libertyfallsdown.wordpress.com/2013/02/22/villanelle/">Liberty's</a>, I was feeling they'd both done very depressing poems. It might be a strict structure of poem, but there's no need to make the subject matter so down!</p>

<p>So here's my overly enthusiastically attempt to try and balance the world of villanelle's into something less depressing!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Striding out down the street at last,<br />
Like I own this town,<br />
Tipping my hat to all that I passed.</p>

  <p>Smiling at a friendly chugger who asked,<br />
Grinning at an exuberant clown,<br />
Striding out down the street at last.</p>

  <p>Saluting the bookie behind his glass,<br />
Turning frowns upside down,<br />
Tipping my hat to all that I passed.</p>

  <p>Tapping my feet and having a blast,<br />
Abusing verbs like they were a noun,<br />
Striding out down the street at last.</p>

  <p>Being amused by kids playing on grass,<br />
Seeing the queen in her glorious crown,<br />
Tipping my hat to all that I passed.</p>

  <p>Compared to sadness I am a contrast,<br />
Cheering folk up in my dressing gown,<br />
Striding out down the street at last,<br />
Tipping my hat to all that I passed.</p>
</blockquote>
