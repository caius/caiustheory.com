      <p>I use a wonderful service for saving text to be read later, <a href="http://instapaper.com/">instapaper.com</a>. It's gotten more wonderful as time has gone on and other applications/service's have gained the ability to save links/articles/webpages there for me to pick up later.</p>

<p>For instance, I'm out and about checking twitter on my iPhone using <a href="http://atebits.com/tweetie-iphone/">tweetie</a> and someone tweets a link. Rather than wait for it to load and having to read it then and there I can just hit "Read Later" and it's saved in my instapaper account for me to read as and when I choose to. Recently the legendary mac feed reader <a href="http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/">NetNewsWire</a> gained this ability too.</p>

<p>There's a few ways to send a feed item to instapaper from within NNW. Firstly you can right-click and click "Send to Instapaper".</p>

<p>Secondly there's a menu item for it in the News menu, which also provides my chosen way of instapapering an item—the keyboard shortcut! ⌃P <em>(control-P)</em>.</p>

<p>So, in NNW I'm happily sending stuff to instapaper with the handy ⌃P shortcut, but that doesn't exist in the third place I mark things to read later–Safari! Up until now I've been using the standard "Read Later" bookmarklet that <a href="http://instapaper.com/">instapaper.com</a> provides, and it's got a spot on my Bookmarks Bar so I can easily click it.</p>

<p>That doesn't really help with the fact I'm hitting ⌃P in NNW, and it doesn't work in Safari. Quite often I noticed myself hitting the key combination in Safari and wondering for a split second why it wasn't sending the item to instapaper. Then the solution hit me!</p>

<p>In OS X you can setup (and/or override) menu items with custom key combinations! Why hadn't I remembered this before. Because the "Read Later" bookmark<em>(let)</em> is nested under the Bookmarks menu, it <strong>is</strong> a menu item! A quick trip into the Keyboards Prefpane in System Preferences and a new binding later and voilâ, "Read Later" in Safari is bound to ⌃P and I can use it in both Safari and NNW.</p>
