"Fun" triathlon (super sprint distance) done in Nantwich. First ever Triathlon, 7 months after starting training properly.

**200m swim: 00:04:08**

Despite feeling like I was going super slow. Brine pool was fairly nice.

**20km bike: 00:52:31**

Pretty happy with that, strongest discipline for me anyway.

**2.5km run: 00:21:08**

Walked 2/3s of it at a guess. Really hate running, so happyish with this. Need to work on running over the winter.

**Total: 1h 17m 47s**

BOOYA. Enjoyable. Pretty damn happy with that (had a vague plan of being under 1h30m. So yay.)
