Back in the day I swapped the keys on my 12" powerbook keyboard around to read `macgenius` across the middle row.

I unearthed the picture, and figured, why not do it to my apple aluminium keyboard? So I found a [tutorial][] from some other guy that'd done it, and dug out my penknife.

After that I decided to rearrange the macbook internal keyboard as well. First I googled around to make sure lifting the keys was the same as doing it on the external keyboard (which it appeared to be), then I went ahead and rearranged them as well.

So whilst I was wondering what to do about it, my mother emailed me and suggested using `ontherails` instead of `macgenius`. So I did, and now the top row reads `ontherails` on the macbooks' internal keyboard.
