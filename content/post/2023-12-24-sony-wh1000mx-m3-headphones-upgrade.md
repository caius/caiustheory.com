A few years ago I picked up a pair of Sony WH-1000X M3 Headphones for using in the office. Very useful and work well in an office and on public transport when I'm comfortable bringing larger devices. After a while I was finding my ears were getting quite hot wearing them all day, especially on hotter days in the summer.

Looking around for upgraded earpads for them I kept finding Dekoni Suede earpads being suggested as a good upgrade. Purchased them from [Electromod][] in the UK: <https://www.electromod.co.uk/dekoni-choice-synthetic-earpads-for-sony-wh1000xm3-headphones>.

Arrived promptly, and an issue around payment was resolved easily by Electromod. Recommend them as a UK retailer.

Fitting the earpads was pretty simple, the old ones lever off and the new ones are pressed into place. From memory I used a plastic spudger to pop the old ones off. The Synthetic Suede

Electromod also carry upgraded earpads for [many other headphones][dekoni-earpads-category], including Sony XM4/XM5 and Bose QC/700's.
