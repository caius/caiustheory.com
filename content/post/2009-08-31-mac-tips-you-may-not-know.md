Here are some mac tips I know and consider "basic" mac knowledge, but no-one else seems to know.

* **exposé** key is on modern mac keyboards, looks like a load of squares on the F3 key.
* **&#x2318; + Exposé key** => Show Desktop
* **&#x2303; + Exposé key** => Show Application Windows
* **&#x2325; + Brightness keys** => Open Displays prefpane in System Preferences.
* **&#x2325; + Exposé key** => Open Exposé & Spaces prefpane in System Preferences.
* **&#x2325; + Dashboard key** => Open Exposé & Spaces prefpane in System Preferences.
* **&#x2325; + Keyboard Backlight keys** => Open Keyboard prefpane in System Preferences. *(Only on laptops with keyboard backlighting.)*
* **&#x2325; + Volume keys** => Open Sound prefpane in System Preferences.
* **&#x21E7; + Volume keys** => Adjust the volume with the feedback noise setting toggled. If you normally have feedback "blips", it'll be silent. Or vice versa.
* **&#x2325; + &#x21E7; + Volume keys** => Adjust the volume in 1/4 of a usual step.
* **&#x2303; + Eject key** => Shows the Shut Down dialog.
* In the shut down dialog, hit *R* to restart, *S* to sleep, *&#x238B;* to cancel.
* (Pretty much) Any dialog that pops up, hitting *&#x238B;* will push the "cancel" button.
* In "Show all windows" or "Show application windows" exposé modes, hit the tab key to cycle through applications.
* Hit the space bar in exposé to activate "Quick Look" + windows pop up to 100% size as you mouse over them.
* Hold down **&#x2303; + &#x21E7;** when mousing over the dock to toggle magnification whilst the keys are down.
