Now I'm not one for blogging about events usually—if I'm attending one then I'll just talk about it on [twitter][] quite a bit beforehand. However, seeing as this one is being organised by my housemate and I like to keep him in a good mood so he doesn't do something daft like change the locks, I figured I'd blog about this one. *(Also its really rather a good idea, I'll be paying to attend and think he's bloody mad to organise a conference!)*

The conference is [Think Visibility][tv], which is a

> one-day mini conference with a focus on the areas of web development and marketing which are usually left behind in the creation process: SEO, PPC, Monetisation, Blogging, Accessibility and Usability.

The [speaker line-up][speakers] has rather a lot of big names in it if you follow the SEO/Online marketing world, and its only £30 to turn up for the day and listen to them speak. Oh, and theres an afterparty with free drinks *(Sponsor permitting)* where you can get drunk with your hero's. (Or something.)

Me, I'm attending simply because up until a year or so ago I thought SEO was a complete heap of crap, but having known [Dom][] for a while, and worked for an SEO agency, I'm starting to appreciate that there is an art to it, and it is a much needed skill to run a successful website.
