This is a something that occasionally makes the rounds again, I've not seen it for a while and I've added some new items since I last remember documenting it. Thus, [@macarne][] [asking][macarne-question] what the app was that gives me stats prompted me to document my current menubar items.

1. [SMCFanControl](http://www.eidac.de/) - Lets me adjust the minimum speed of my fans.
2. [Tweetie/mac](http://atebits.com/tweetie-mac)
3. [iScrobbler](http://iscrobbler.sourceforge.net/) - Scrobbles tunes iTunes plays
4. [LittleSnapper](http://www.realmacsoftware.com/littlesnapper/) *(Or more accurately the menubar icon is NanoSnapper, LittleSnapper is the full app.)* Mainly used for screen grabs.
5. [SlimBatteryMonitor](http://www.orange-carb.org/SBM/) - Takes up less horizontal space than Apple's menu item.
6. Expresscard menu item - Lets me power off my [Expresscard/34 SSD](http://www.memoryc.com/storage/solidstatedisk/48gbfilematesolidgoexpresscardultra.html)
7. [MenuMeters](http://www.ragingmenace.com/software/menumeters/) - An old friend I've been using for as long as I can remember running OS X. Set to show (left to right)
    1. Ram - **U**sed and **F**ree totals.
    2. Network - Graph + values.
    3. CPU - Graph per core. Probably the most useful out of the three.
8. Bluetooth
9. Time Machine
10. Modem - To dial on my Huawei E220 3G stick.
11. Airport
12. Sound
13. Day/Time
14. Fast User Switching - Not sure why I keep this in the menubar, only have one user and I lock my screen with a password protected screensaver.
15. [Viscosity](http://www.viscosityvpn.com/) - VPN software. Pretty useful.
16. Spotlight! - Occasionally this vanishes when spotlight decides to be a dick and eat ram/cpu reindexing my disk every few hours. Touch wood it hasn't done it since 10.6.1.
